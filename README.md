# Data-Scientist-Capstone---Coursera
This capstone project applies an end-to-end data science workflow to SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data. Using API data collection, EDA, visualization, and machine learning models, the project analyzes key factors affecting booster landing success and predicts landing outcomes to support data-driven decision-making.

Please, enjoyed my work
